Variance of the return of a stock is equal to its beta squared times the variance of market return(systematic risk)
plus the variance of the residual in the regression (idiosyncratic risk).

for a regression line y = mx + b,

y - expected return on a individual stock. (ex: AAPL)
x - expected overall market return (ex. S&P 500)
m - Beta, correlation on how much the individual stock moves with the market. (measure of systematic risk)
b - Aplha, represents idiosyncratic risk of the individual stock, independent of market movements. 
    (high constant == high variability independent of market variability)
