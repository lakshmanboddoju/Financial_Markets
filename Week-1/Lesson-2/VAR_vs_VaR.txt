VaR - Value at Risk, it's a measure used by some finance people to quantify risk of of an investment or of a portfolio.
      It's quoted in units of dollars for a given probability and time horizon. 
      For example, if it says lets's say 1%, one-year value at risk of 10 million, 
      it means that there is a 1% chance that the portfolio will lose 10 million in one year.
