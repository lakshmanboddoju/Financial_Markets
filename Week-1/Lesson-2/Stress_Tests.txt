Stress Test :
           It's a measure/a method of assessing risks to firms or portfolios. 
           The idea of a stress test is to look at a portfolio not just by its historical returns and how variable they are, 
           but let's look at the details of the portfolio and ask what vulnerabilities there are for various kinds of financial crisis, 
           because what actually stresses firms the most are crisis, it's not just normal variation.
